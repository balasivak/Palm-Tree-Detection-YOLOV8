# Palm Tree Detection using YOLOv8 + Roboflow + Flask

This project implements an end-to-end palm tree detection pipeline using the YOLOv8 object detection model, Roboflow for dataset integration, and a Flask web application for user image uploads and visualization of detection results.

The model is trained on an aerial palm tree dataset and optimized for deployment on both low-resource and production environments.

## 📊 Model Accuracy & Performance

This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for detecting palm trees in aerial imagery. The model was trained on a Roboflow-labeled dataset with advanced augmentations and tuned hyperparameters to optimize detection performance for palm clusters in various environments.

### Training Details

- **Model**: YOLOv8s (small variant for a balance of speed and accuracy)
- **Dataset Source**: Roboflow (Aerial Palm Tree Dataset)
- **Image Size**: 512 × 512
- **Epochs**: 20
- **Batch Size**: 6 (optimized for 4GB GPU)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Augmentations**:
  - Horizontal Flip
  - HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) shifts
  - Small rotation (up to ±7 degrees)
  - MixUp and Copy-Paste
  - Perspective adjustment
- **Training Framework**: Ultralytics YOLOv8

### Evaluation Results

After training, the model achieved an **accuracy of 89%**, validated using a held-out test set and visual inspection of bounding boxes.
